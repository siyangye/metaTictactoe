# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe takes the classic tic-tac-toe game to a new level. In this variation, two players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. However, unlike traditional tic-tac-toe, this game involves **9 simultaneous instances** of tic-tac-toe, adding a complex and strategic layer to the gameplay.

### Gameplay

- **Objective:** The primary objective is to be the first player to get 3 in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the meta-game grid.
- **Meta-Game Grid:** The game boards are arranged in a larger 3x3 grid. Each of the 9 squares contains an independent game of tic-tac-toe.
- **Turns:** Each turn, a player can choose to make a single move in any of the 9 tic-tac-toe boards.
- **Game Balance:** Players are not required to respond directly in the same board and can choose any of the 9 boards for their move, potentially leading to unbalanced numbers of moves across different boards.
- **Winning a Board:** Once a player wins on one of the smaller boards, that boardâ€™s square is claimed in the larger meta-game grid.
- **Ties:** If a game instance results in a tie, that board is reset to an empty board and is open for play again.

### Winning the Game

The game ends when a player successfully claims three boards in a row on the meta-game grid, similar to traditional tic-tac-toe rules.
